## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Phase 1 scaffold complete: forked from Pi Agent, rebranded as `@sns-myagent/cli` with `snscoder` binary (commit `d1480eb`)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with staged verify → install → typecheck → lint → build → diagnose jobs
- BYOK provider config system with `.sns-myagent/config.yaml` + env overrides
- Real source-derived inventory of 58 built-in slash commands and 70+ tools documented in README
- `docs/memory.md` covering mnemopi / mnemosyne / mem0 / lcm backends
- `docs/tbm.md` Token Budget Manager reference
- `SECURITY.md` vulnerability reporting + security model
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` dev setup + commit conventions
- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` cross-platform installers
- Phase 1.5: prebuilt Linux x64 standalone binary (`bin/snscoder-linux-x64`) produced via `bun build --compile` in `scripts/build-binary.ts`
- Phase 1.5: integration smoke tests (`test/integration/`) covering CLI binary launch + version/help output
- Phase 1.5: `grammy` dependency added for the Telegram adapter (`src/telegram/` adapter stub)
- Phase 1.5: default-config YAML writer (`DEFAULT_CONFIG_YAML` in `src/config/defaults.ts`) — first-run writes a real `config.yaml` instead of silently no-op

### Changed
- Bumped `@oh-my-pi/*` packages from `16.1.15` → `16.1.18`
- `bin/snscoder` entrypoint now resolves to `bin/snscoder.js`
- README rewritten to remove fabricated slash-commands and tools tables — all claims now sourced from `src/`
- CHANGELOG Phase 2 entries flagged Telegram bot as not yet shipped (no `src/telegram/` files)
- `package.json` `build` script moved from inline `bun build` flags to `bun scripts/build-binary.ts` for readability
- `src/config/defaults.ts` now exports `DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE`, `DEFAULT_CONFIG_YAML`, `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` to satisfy `src/config/index.ts` import (was 4 pre-existing TS errors)

### Removed
- Dead code: `src/shims/pi-agent-core-shim.ts` — never imported anywhere, kept only as a self-documented escape hatch that became obsolete once `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core` 16.1.18 barrel re-exports stabilised
- `package.json.orig` migration artifact (superseded by current `package.json`; diff captured in `.sns-myagent/`)
- `src/shims/` directory (empty after shim removal)

### Fixed
- 4 pre-existing TS errors at `src/config/index.ts:20` — missing exports on `defaults.ts` (`DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE`, `DEFAULT_CONFIG_YAML`, `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_PROVIDER`)

### Status
- Latest released version: [0.1.0] — 2026-06-23
- Internal phase tracker: see `PROGRESS.md` (gitignored, not on GitHub)
